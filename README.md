AMBER: Advancing Multimodal Brain-Computer Interfaces for Enhanced Robustness -A Dataset for Naturalistic Settings

Welcome to the "AMBER" dataset repository!

AMBER stands for Advancing Multimodal Brain-Computer Interfaces for Enhanced Robustness, and it is an open-source dataset designed to facilitate research in naturalistic settings. This dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers aiming to develop signal-denoising techniques for Electroencephalography (EEG) measurements, leveraging contextual signal sources.

In the AMBER dataset, participants were instructed to produce specific artifacts, simulating real-world EEG recording challenges according to a pre-defined protocol. The dataset comprises raw recordings from 10 healthy subjects, along with a processed subset of the data for illustrative purposes.

Researchers can harness the power of the AMBER dataset to explore and develop novel approaches for enhancing EEG signal quality and performing noise reduction. By leveraging this dataset, we aim to advance the field of brain-computer interfaces in naturalistic settings.

You can access the AMBER dataset at the following repository [link to the repository]. We encourage the research community to utilize this dataset to further our understanding of brain-computer interfaces and improve their performance in real-world scenarios.

We welcome collaborations and contributions from researchers worldwide to maximize the potential impact of the AMBER dataset and advance the field together. Happy exploring!
